## 蛋糕胚
<u>材料 (materials)</u>
- 5个凉鸡蛋 (5 cold eggs from fridge)
- 75g牛奶 (75g milk)
- 60g玉米油 (60g corn oil)
- 80g低筋面粉 (80g low gluten flour)
- 30g可可粉 (30g cocoa powder)
- 75g细砂糖 (75g granulated sugar (or sugars in general should do))

<u>步骤一 (part 1)</u>
1. 打五个鸡蛋
2. 蛋白和蛋黄分离

(a more detailed step 1 & 2 in english cause the original mandarin explanation is too vague)

fyi, an egg has 3 components
- shell (which you should know what it is)
- albumen (the white part, also the part that matters the most for making this)
- yolk (the yellow part)

whisk an egg into a bowl. use a spoon to get the yolk out and leave it in a different bowl. __make sure__ there is as little yolk in the original bowl (which, by now, should be filled with albumen). repeat the same step 5 times using the same bowls. you should end up with something like this:

(albumen)

(yolk)

small side knowledge, if there is too much yolk in the albumen bowl, the mixing part will take a lot longer in part2, but still doable, and result is the same.

3. 牛奶和玉米油搅拌混合 (mix all milks and corn oil into a bowl)
4. 把面粉和可可粉用筛网筛入上一步的混合物中，然后混合 (sift the flour and cocoa powder into the compound from previous step, and mix them)
5. 加入蛋黄到混合物中 (add yolk to it as well, mix them, part 1 complete)

<u>步骤二 (part 2)</u>
1. 蛋白里加入几滴柠檬汁
add few drops of lemon juice to the albumen(not mandatory, but makes merging reaction quicker, sort of like a catalyst from chemistry)
 
2. 细砂糖分三次平均加入，打发成固体状态
start whipping the albumen, while whipping, add sugar in it (1/3 each time), until it becomes solid (usually pretty long, 20 minutes for me, but might be longer/quicker depending on your setup, like if the bowl is entirely clean or not)

3. 与第一步的混合物快速混合
quickly mix it with the compound from part 1

4. 放入八寸模具，震出气炮
pour it into a 8-inch mold, and gently tap the mold to the table.

5. 放入烤箱150度50分钟
place the mold into the oven at 150 degree celsius for 50 minutes

6. 倒扣，冷凉，平切成三层
invert the cake, let it cool, then slice it equally into three layers

（蛋糕胚完成）
(base cake complete!)

## 奶油 (creme)
<u>材料 (materials)</u>
- 淡奶油700g (whipping cream 700g)
- 细砂糖40g (sugar 40g)
- ~~海盐2g（可选）
- 奥利奥饼干碎60g (entirely broken oreo cookie 60g)
![[img_0134.jpeg]]
<u>步骤</u>
1. 砂糖加入淡奶油中，搅拌打发至7分发 (add the sugar to the cream, whip until soft peaks form (i don't really know what that mean either, i usually just whip it until i feel like it looks nice))

2. 加入饼干碎，搅拌均匀 (add oreo cookie in, and start mixing)
3. 在蛋糕胚上使用奶油裱花 (creme part done! now just decorate it on the cake)

what i usually do to decorate with the cream:
- add a certain amount of creme between each layer of the cake.
- use some tools to piping the uppermost layer of the cake, add some fruits (i usually go with blueberry but you can play around with other fruits).
- also add some oreo chocolates (non broken ones), on the surface to make things look nice

here is an example of cake i made before
