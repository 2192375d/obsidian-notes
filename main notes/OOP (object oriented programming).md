# procedural paradigm vs OOP
procedural paradigm:
- focuses on designing methods
- data and operations on the data are seperate

object oriented paradigm:
- couples methods and data together into objects
- organizes programs in a way that mirrors the real world
- a program can be viewed as a collection of cooperating objects
- makes programs easier to develop and maintain
- improves software reusability

# main aspects of OOP
- encapsulation
- abstraction
- inheritance
- polymorphism
