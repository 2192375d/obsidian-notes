2. Confirm location and plan out the transit (although it's most likely online)
3. Choose a professional outfit (no baseball hat), dry-clean if necessary
4. Prepare reference, and only present it if requested by the employer
5. Review job posting

During the night before interview

2. Review key documents, go over T-analysis, resume, cover letter, and any other application materials
3. Prepare 3-5 questions to ask the employer at the end of the interview
4. Practice skill-based stories for a strong STARR response
5. Get a good rest (no)

# arriving for the interview
- No food or drinks
- Use your notepad for 3-post interview questions

- Appear professional from the moment entering the door

# tips to look professional
- Clothes fit well and look polished/professional
- Avoid anything too tight, too baggy, or improperly sized
- Ensure clothing is clean and wrinkle-free to look sharp and put together
- When unsure about colors, stick to neutral tones like black, beige, taupe, brown, blue, or grey.
Don't spend to much money just for that
