# Prenex Normal form
A predicate formal is in __PNF__ iff it has form
$$
Q_{1}x_{1}Q_{2}x_{2}\dots Q_{k}x_{k}E
$$
where $k\in\mathbb{N}$
- each $Q_{i}$ is $\exists$ or $\forall$
- each $x_{i}$ is a variable
- $E$ is quantifier free

## PNF theorem
Every predicate formula is logically equivalent to a PNF formula
