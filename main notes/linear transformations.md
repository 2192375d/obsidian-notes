# definition
Let $M$ be a $2 \times 2$ matrix with $\det M\neq 0$, and let $T$ be a linear map of $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{R}^2$ given by
$$
T(\mathbf{x})=M(\mathbf{x})
$$
Then $T$ transforms parallelograms into parallelograms and vertices into vertices. Moreover, if $T(D^*)$ is a parallelgram, then $D^*$ is a parallelogram.
