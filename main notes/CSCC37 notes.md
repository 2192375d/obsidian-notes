[[CSCC37 course information]]

## CSCC37 LEC2
(nothing new)

## CSCC37 LEC3
[[numerical analysis]]

# prestudied stuffs

## CSCC37 tb chapter 1
[[Big O notation]]

[[data error and computational error]]
[[truncation error and rounding error]]
[[absolute error and relative error]]
[[condition of error]]
[[backward error analysis]] (lazy to write stuffs)
[[floating point systems and numbers]]
[[normalization of floating point system]]
[[properties of floating point system]]
[[floating point rounding]]
[[machine precision]] ($\epsilon_{mach}$)
[[exceptional values]]
[[floating point arithmetic]] (empty for now)

## CSCC37 tb chapter 2
[[singularity and nonsingularity]]
[[solvability of matrix]]
[[permutation matrix]]
[[diagonal matrix scalling]] (empty for now)
(all that stupid Gaussian elimination stuffs, too boring)
[[vector norm]]
[[vector norm properties]]
[[matrix norms]]
[[matrix norms properties]]
[[matrix condition]]
[[matrix condition properties]]
[[solution residual and relative residual]]
(stuffs regarding LU factorization and relative residual, essentially it says $\displaystyle \frac{||E||}{||A||}\leq \rho n\epsilon_{mach}$, where $\rho$ is the growth factor, defined as the ratio of the largest entry of $U$ to the largest entry of $A$. In practice we just use $\displaystyle \frac{||E||}{||A||}\approx n\epsilon_{mach}$)
[[linear system estimating accuracy]]
(improving accuracy stuffs)
[[special types of linear systems]] (empty for now)
[[properties of special types of linear systems]] (empty for now)

## CSCC37 tb chapter 5
(just a bunch of stuffs like Newton's method to approximate solutions to non linear systems, too boring)

## CSCC37 tb chapter 7
