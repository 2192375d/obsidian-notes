# software development process
Two contrasting approaches:
- waterfall
- agile

## waterfall model
A traditional approach for software development, and is a sequencial (non-iterative) model

However, waterfall model cannot adapt to making changes when coding. Especially changes for requirements, which means to restart down the trend

## agile model
Examples of agile methodologies
- extreme programing (XP)
- scrum
- test-driven development (TDD)
- feature-driven development

Agile manifesto:
"
We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work, we come to value:
- individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- working software over comprehensive documentation
- customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- responding to change over following a plan
That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more
"

(Dunno if this will be used anytime)
