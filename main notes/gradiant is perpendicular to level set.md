# Theorem: $\nabla f$ is perpendicular to level sets
Suppose that $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ is differentiable at $\mathbf{x}_0$ and $\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_0) \neq 0$.

Let $c = f(\mathbf{x}_0)$ and consider the level set 
$$L_c = \{\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n \colon f(\mathbf{x} = c\}$$
passing through $\mathbf{x}_0$. Then the gradient vector $\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_0)$ is perpendicular to the tangent plane of $L_c$ at $\mathbf{x}_0$.
