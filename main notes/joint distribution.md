# multivariate distribution
__Multivariate distribution__ can have multiple RV's defined in random experiment
	e.g. Roll two 6-sided dice and let X be value of 1st die, Y be value of 2nd die

multivariate distribution with two variables describe pairs of RV values as coordinates in 2D space, are called jiont distribution


# joint (bivariate) distribution
Let $X, Y$ be RVs __joint distribution__ is the collection of all probabilities of form$$P((X,Y)\in B)=P(\{s\in S:(X(s),Y(s))\in B\}),\forall B\subset R^2$$ In other words, the $(X,Y)$ values are within a subset $B$ of $R^2$
