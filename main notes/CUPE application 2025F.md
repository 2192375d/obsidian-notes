## General approaches to cover letters
- Introductory paragraph: As someone who struggled to even get a low 60s in math courses 0, and one who eventually managed to overcome those challenges, I really want to help other people to the same as well.

- Story begin back grade 9, I was a math beginner who was barely able to get a low 60 in math courses; from grade 11 to grade 12, I worked super hard and eventually managed to overcome those challenges; by today, I really want to help people avoid 

(introductory paragraph)
 Story began right after I graduated high school. Out of excitement for my new university life, I started self-prestudying MATA31 contents while having a hard time understanding complicated concepts. Once I overcame the encountered difficulties, the one thing I really want to achieve that no one will fall into my struggles again. Thus, I want to take the opportunity to become a TA in the CUPE program and achieve this. I believe that with my previous works in organizing group study sessions, alongside with my experience in creating external course contents such as flowcharts, will make me suitable for this job.

(body paragraph 1)
 Near the end of 2025W semester, I realized we had no review seminar for the MATA22 final exam; thus, considering the difficulty of this course, I decided to orgainze a 30 people group study session on my own to help my classmates and myself to ready-up for tricky problems alongside with boosting their overall confidence for this tough challenge. To make this study session work out nicely, I practiced six of the previous years exams and multiple challenging questions from "LADR" and "A Course in Linear Algebra". After doing so, I selected, rewrote, and latexed 8 problems that were both interesting and candidates for the exam as the content I want to discuss with other students. After this setup is done, I further discussed about the questions with professors/TAs to make sure the quality is high enough. Finally, I found an empty room in IA and spent 3 hours practicing explaining the problems on the blackboard. The study session end up been a great aid for the participant, as they end up achieving an overall average of 13% better than their previous exam grades. I believe that this experience of myself "mimicking" a TA, can demonstrate my will to help other students and showcase my ability in selecting and going through tough problems, resulting me been a great TA for MATA31 course.

(body paragraph 2)
 One thing interesting happened to me during my study for MATA31 course. We were learning mathematical concepts including definitions and theorems, and all of the them are defined/derived based on previous definitions/theorems. Soon, I realized all of those concepts are connected with each other in an interesting way, and it would be great if I can make a flowchart out of it. With this idea in mind, I immediately started listing down every concepts with bullet points, and took notes of what each definitions are defined based on, alongside with what eacSTAB52h theorems are proven from. After all that are done, I started drawing the flowchart, with different colours/shapes for each nodes to assure other fellow students can get the most out of it. The flowchart ends up posted on Piazza and received many praises from other students and course instructor; it also led me to create flowcharts for both MATA37 and MATA22. This experience exposes my ability in seen the connections between different course contents, and clearly deliver them to the students in the most straightforward way as a TA for MATA31.

(end paragraph)
 I believe that my previous experiences in organizing group study session to help classmates and creating flowchart are great examples of both my passion in teaching others to understand math, alongside with my strong ability in selecting suitable math problems and deliver them to students correctly as a TA. I always wanted to work as a TA in the CUPE program since this opportunity not only can help other people in deepening their understandings in math, it also makes myself to feel more confident and satisfied with all the interesting knowledges I learned. With both my experiences in flowcharting and doing TA's work for passion, I am confident that I can help the future students to achieve a great experience in their potentially first math course.


## Todos
- Push linear algebra calculator on Github
- Push entire obsidian on Github and public it, also post all my A31 course notes


## Things to ask about STAB52 application (already done)
- I never took C62, but I can try to self-study, can I get a chance for it?
- I had experiences hosting study session with 20+ people for A22, and the current course. What I did waSTAB52s that I helped them go through tough problems and tricks to remember in the exam (based on my experiences after doing all of the previous midterms), afterwards I sampled the data and the mean was 77.5% from them.
- I made flowcharts for all definitions, theorems for A31, A37, A22, and shared it for free on piazza to help people study.
- If it's not very probable for me to get the position, anything I can do to get other courses position?
