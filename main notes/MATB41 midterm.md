## To ask
- On the exam, do we have to memorize the formal definitions (e.g. what is an open set), or can we provide a geometrical definition that also makes sense it's dedicated for human beings to understand crazy math nerds.

## Things to remember
- $\displaystyle f(x)\approx\sum_{k=0}^{n}\frac{f^k(a)}{k!}(x-a)^k$
- $\displaystyle\ln(t)\approx\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{(-1)^{t+1}(t-1)^k}{k!}$
- $\displaystyle e^{t}=\sum_{k=0}^n \frac{x^k}{k!}$
- $\displaystyle\sin(t)\approx \sum_{k=0}^n\frac{(-1)^{k}x^{2k+1}}{(2k+1)!}$
- $\displaystyle\cos(t)\approx \sum_{k=0}^n\frac{(-1)^{k}x^{2k}}{(2k)!}$
- $\displaystyle\frac{1}{1-x}\approx \sum_{k=0}^nx^k$

- Remember that $x^2-y^2=1$ is a hyperbola! Never forget!
- The Jacobian matrix of a function $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m$ has $m$ rows and $n$ columns.
- Meeting the y-axis means $x=0,z=0$! Don't make stupid mistake!!!- - -
- When writing a definition, remember to mention details such as the function is differentiable at a point blablabla
- If it says to write parametric equation, write parametric! Don't make stupid mistake!!!- - -
