Consider __variable of interest__ (e.g. income) from some population with unknown mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$.

To calculate those quantities will take forever, you have to ask every individual of them (lots of cost).
So instead, we estimate the mean $\mu$ without looking at entire population, but using __random sampling__ instead.
To do so, we consider the sample statistics.
