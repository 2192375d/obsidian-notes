# choice of interpolating function
When interpolating functions, we need to consider:
- what form should the function have? (think about if it's physical or mathematical)
- how should function behave between data points?
- should function have the same properties of the data, such as monotonicity, convexity and periodicity?
- when plotting the function, should the results be visually pleasing?
- how easy is the function to work with?

some types of functions commonly used as interpolant include:
- polynomials
- piecewise polynomials
- trigonometric
- exponentials
- rationals
