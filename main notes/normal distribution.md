# definition
RV $X$ follows normal distribution with parameters mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, denoted by $X\sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$, it has a PDF of 
$$
f(x)=\frac{e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} \right)^2}}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma},x\in\mathbb{R}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2\pi }\sigma}\exp \left\{  - \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2  \right\}
$$
where $\mu$ is called the <i>mean</i> and $\sigma$ is called <i>standard deviation</i> 
$N(0,1)$ is a special case, we call it standard normal
