# second derivative test in multivariable calculus
Let $f:U\to\mathbb{R}$ be of class $C^2$ and $x_{0}$ be a critical point of $f$, then
- if $Hf(x_{0})$ is positive definite, then $x_{0}$ is a local minimum of $f$
- if $Hf(x_{0})$ is negative definie, then $x_{0}$ is a local maximum of $f$
- if $Hf(x_{0})$ is neither and $\det(Hf(x_{0}))\neq 0$, then $x_{0}$ is a saddle point of $f$
