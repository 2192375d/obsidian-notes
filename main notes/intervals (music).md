# intervals review
- PU: perfect unison (0 semitone)
- m2: minor 2nd (1 semitone)
- M2: major 2nd (2 semitone)
- m3: minor 3rd (3 semitone)
- M3: major 3rd (4 semitone)
- P4: perfect 4th (5 semitone)
- x5 or o5: tritone (6 semitone)
- P5: perfect 5th (7 semitone)
- m6: minor 6th (8 semitone)
- M6: major 6th (9 semitone)
- m7: minor 7th (10 semitone)
- M7: major 7th (11 semitone)
- P8: perfect octave (12 semitone)

Note that tritone is also called "perfect 5th"

## general pattern
- minor: major -= 1 semitone
- diminished: perfect -= 1 semitone
- augmented: major/perfect += 1 semitone

## invert interval
To invert an interval, we substract the interval from 12

eg: The invert interval of m3 is M6 because 12 - 3 = 9, which corresponds to M6
