We decided to use BST because we need a datatype that
- Uses dynamic memory unlike array
- Able to perform searches as quick as binary search unlike linked list
- Have a low computational cost

Binary search tree's left sub-tree holds values smaller or equal to the value of the data in the node. With right sub-tree ___boring___
