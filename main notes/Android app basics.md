# Android app basics
An Android app is a collection of screens, and each screen is comprised of a layout and an activity
- layout: describes the appearance of a screen (written in XML)
- activity: responsible for managing user interaction with the screen (written in Java or Koplin)

An activity can make use of one or more fragments, which promotes modularity
