# definition 
RV $X$ is <b>continuous</b> if $$P(X=x)=0, \forall x\in \mathbb{R}$$This means, $PMF = 0$
Note that $P(S) = 1$ is still the case even if $P(X=x)=0$ because X can have uncountably many values

The probabilities of continuous RVs are calculated via calculus

# probabilities for continuous RVs
For continuous RV $X$, $$P(X\in(a,b])=P(a<X\leq b), \forall a<b\in\mathbb{R}$$Note that interval does not matter$$P(X\in(a,b])=P(X\in(a,b))=P(X\in[a,b))=P(X\in[a,b])$$Calculating interval probability can be done in two ways:
- cumulative distribution functions (CDF)
- probability distribution functions (PDF)
