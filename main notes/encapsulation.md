# encapsulation
- private: only accessible from the top level class where it is declared
- package private: accessible from anywhere in the package where it is declared (this is the default one)
- protected: accessible from subclasses of the class
- public: accessible anywhere
(Rule of thumb: make each member as inaccessible as possible)
