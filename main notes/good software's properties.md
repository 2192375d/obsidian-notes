# modularity
The software is composed of seperate modules each of which has one particular task, and most of them are self-contained, can be understood, tested, and maintained independently of the others.

This can help in
- reduce code reuse
- improve the chance that the code will be reused
- make it easier to test the code
- help understanding the structure of the software

# maintainability
The software needs to be organized, easy to understand, well documented, and contain as little unnecessary complexity as possible.
Doing so will improve the ability to test, debug, and upgrade it.
In general, a good developer not familiar with the code should be able to quickly get to the point where they can work with it.

# openess
Try contributing to open source software community if possible

# privacy
Some software requires you to write a system running over a network. In that case, try protecting user's privacy.
