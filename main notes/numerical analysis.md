# what is numerical analysis?`
Physics systems need mathematical models, and mathematical models need analytic/numerical solutions.

- analytic solution: differential equation $\displaystyle g'(t)=t^2\to g(t)=\frac{t^3}{3}+C$
- numerical solution: $g'(t)=F(g(t))$, need numerics...?

## why mathematical models?
- It is often the only approach
- often cheeper nad more flexible than physical models

## why numerical solutions?
- often the only approach
- can be cheeper than the analytic solution
