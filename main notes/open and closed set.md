# boundary point
A point $p$ is a __boundary point__ of $U$ if every disk $D_{\epsilon}(p)$ centered at $p$ countains at least one point in $U$ and one point not in $U$

# closed set
A set $D$ is closed if it countains all boundary points

# open set
A set $D$ is open if it countains no boundary point
