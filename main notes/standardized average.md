# definition
Consider a sequence of independent RVs $X_{1},\dots,X_{n}$ with common $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, then, their __standardized average__ is
$$
Z_{n}=\left( \frac{\overline{X}_{n}-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{ n }} \right)=\sqrt{ n }\left( \frac{\overline{X}_{n}-\mu}{\sigma} \right)
$$

__Standardizing__ means to substract mean and divide by standard deviation

# theorem
Standardized RVs always have a mean of 0 and a variance of 1
