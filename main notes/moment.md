__Moments__ of RV $X$ are expected values of different powers of $X$
- The __rth moment__ of $X$ is defined as: $E(X^r)$
- The __rth central moment__ of $X$ is defined as: $E[(x-\mu)^r]$

In particular, 
- 1st moment is the mean: $E(X^1)=\mu$,
- the 1st central moment is 0: $E(X-\mu)=E(X)-\mu=0$,
- the 2nd central moment is the variance: $E[(X-\mu)^2]=V(X)=\sigma^2$

moments of RV$X$ describe different aspects of its distribution
- mean describes center
- variance describes spread
- 3rd central moment describes symmetry (skewness)
- 4th central moment describes tail behavior (kurtosis)
