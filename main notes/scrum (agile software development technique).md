# scrum
Scrum is currently the most widely used methodologies of software development

For each individual sprints, developers need to develop some features (from product backlog), where those features are called scrum backlog

## overall mechanism

## roles
product owner
- responsible for delivering requirements and accepting demos
- involved in planning session
scrum master
- responsible for removing impediments
team members
- no one has a fixed role other than the scrum master and product owner
- everyone takes on tasks, and completes them based on what they are most comfortable with

## user stories
User stories are similar to requirements, they are written in the following format:
- As a {ACTOR/OBJECT} I want to {ACTION} so that {RESULT}

## planning session
Planning sessions happen at the start of each sprint

They usually take a few hours. During this time, the team decides how much work it will take on and dicusses any major technical challenges they expect to face

Usually, product owners are available for at least a portion of this meeting, to help with prioritization. They are only there to assist in this regard, and not to dictate what the team will complete.


## working agreement
A series of statements that everyone on the team agrees to about how the team will work
Things in working agreements may include:  
- The standup will occur at 1:00 pm every day, and last 15 minutes  
- We will not speak during the standup, unless it is our turn to speak  
- Our meetings will take place in the lobby of the IC building  
- All code must be peer-reviewed  
- We will submit all code 24 hours prior to the due date

## definition of done
A formal agreement of when work is considered complete
For example, a story can be marked as done when:
- It has been fully unit tested
- It successfully integrated with the rest of the code
- It has been peer reviewed
- It is fully commented
- It is important that the team comes to an agreement on this definition before they start work
