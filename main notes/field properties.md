# field properties
1. The additive identity and multiplicative identity (also the inverses) are ALL unique
2. $a \cdot 0=0$, for all $a\in\mathbb{F}$
3. The additive identity of a field has no multiplicative inverse
4. $0\neq 1$, so field must have at least 2 elements
5. cancellation laws: $a+b=c+b \to a=c$ and $a \cdot b=c \cdot b\to a=c$
6. If $a \cdot b=0,a,b\in\mathbb{F}$, then either $a=0$ or $b=0$
