# singular matrix
An $n\times n$ matrix $A$ is said to be __singular__ if it is not invertable

## recall: non invertable matrix property
For an $n\times n$ matrix A, the following properties are equivalent
- $A$ has no inverse
- $\det(A)=0$
- $rank(A)<n$
- $Az=0$ for some vector $z\neq 0$

# nonsingular matrix
An $n\times n$ matrix $A$ is said to be __nonsingular__ if it is invertable
