# Cartesian product from B36 tb(0.3)
Let $A,B$ be sets, then the __Cartesian product__ of $A$ and $B$, denoted $A \times B$ is the set of all ordered pairs where the first element is from $A$ and second element is from $B$. 
In other words, the __Cartesian product__ of $A$ and $B$ is
$$
\{(a,b):a\in A,b\in B)\}
$$
## Cartesian product properties
- If either $A$ or $B$ is empty, then $A \times B$ is empty.
- $|A\times B|=|A||B|$
- If $A$ and $B$ are nonempty and $A\neq B$, then $A\times B\neq B\times A$
