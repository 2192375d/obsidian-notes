# context free grammar
A __context free grammar__ is a 4-tuple defined as $G=(V,\Sigma,P,S)$, where
- $V$ is a finite set of __variables__
- $\Sigma$ is a set of __terminals__, where $V \cup \Sigma = \emptyset$
- $P$ is the set of __productions__, that is a binary relation $P\subset V\times\Sigma$
- $S$ is the __starting symbol__ ($S\in V$)

## context free language (CFL)
A __context free language__ is the language generated by a CFG $G$, denoted as $\mathcal{L}(G)$
