# ordered pairs && tripplets from B36 tb(0.2)
An __ordered pair__ $(a,b)$ can be defined rigorously using sets.
Specifically, the __ordered pair__ $(a,b)$ can be defined as the set $\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}$

An __ordered tripplet__ $(a,b,c)$ can be defined as $(a,(b,c))$ using ordered pair definition. This can extend to any n-tuples of length of any integer $n>1$.
