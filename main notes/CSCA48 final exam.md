# to remember
- __IMPLEMENTATION DETAIL__ IS NOT PART OF THE API
- When allocating for a graph of adjacency list, should write with two asterisks
```
g->adj_list = (Node **)calloc(V, sizeof(Node));
```
- Prepending when converting anything to an adj list

# to do
- quiz 3_1 _todo_
- quiz 3_2 _todo_
- 2022 final _todo_
- bst practice _todo_
- Rawad Question set 2 _done_ _to check_

- End of chapter 1 question _done_
- End of chapter 2 question _done_
- End of chapter 3 question _to do_
- End of chapter 4 question _to do_
- End of chapter 5 question _to do_
- End of chapter 6 question _to do_

- calculate the time efficiencies of the RQ questions
- implement a function that converts a BST to a sorted BST. Calculate the efficiency
## algorithm efficiencies to memorize/understand
- All the arrays
- All the linked list's
- All the BST's
- All the graph's (mat and list)

This should include:
- insert
- sort
- delete (individual)
- delete (entire)
- print (traverse)
- search

|             | insert |
| ----------- | ------ |
| linked list |        |
| bst         |        |
|             |        |
| array       |        |


## results of algorithms
- Understand when to use array/linked list/BST
- Everything else

## chapter 6
- Review what's an API
- Review OOP

## other (less important) contents to review
- tutorials
- assignments (maybe calculate the functions' efficiency?)
- piazza posts (maybe not)
