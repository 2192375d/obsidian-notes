# relation from B36 tb (0.4)
A __relation__ $R$ between sets $A$ and $B$ is a subset of the $A\times B$:
$$
R\subset A\times B
$$

Same goes with relation between sets $A_{1},\dots,A_{n}$, where the relation $R$ is a set S.T
$$
R\subset A_{1}\times \dots \times A_{n}
$$

## arity
Consider $R$ as a relation between sets $A_{1},\dots,A_{n}$, then the __arity__ of the $R$ is n.

Note for $R$ as a relation between sets $A,B$, (e.g. arity 2 relation), the relation is called a __binary relation__

When all $n$ sets are the same, let's denote the set to be $A$, then the relation between them is an __n-ary relation over $A$__.
