- Can you please explain me the last example in week 2?
- (Share her the easier way of doing practice exam Q3b, even though the logics behind the solutions are the same)
- Do we have to state the theorem if it's obvious which theorem we are using? (Eg since $\ker(T)=\{ 0 \}$, wer get T is one-to-one)
- (Maybe) complain about multiple choice having an option for "None of the above"
- For Q5d, what is the good approach to it?
- Is the practice exam we have a good representation of the actual exam?
- What does it mean by "We are expected to write exams using pens?", Can I use pencil?
_done_

- How do you prove this? I saw this on a textbook
Let $u,v\in V$, with $v\neq 0$
Set $\displaystyle c=\frac{\left\langle  u,v \right\rangle}{||v||^2}$ and $\displaystyle w=u- \frac{\left\langle  u,v \right\rangle}{||v||^2}v$, then
$$
\langle w,v\rangle=0 \text{ and } u=cv+w
$$
- An interesting true or false problem: Let $W$ be subspace, with a basis $\alpha$, then is it true that $W^{\perp}=\alpha^{\perp}$
- How do we prove the 5 properties of orthogonal matrix? (just curious), I managed to get the conclusion of:
  if $A\in\mathcal{M}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, $A=\{ a_{ij} \}$, where $1\leq i,j\leq n$, then $\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^na_{ji}a_{ij}=\begin{cases} 1,j=k \\ 0,j\neq k\end{cases}$
- Also funny story, we learned diagonalization as $A=CDC^{-1}$ instead of $D=CAC^{-1}$
