Many probabilistic calculations are difficult/impossible to perform analytically, but can be approximated with approximation
Foundation of every simulation experiment is to generate RV values from some target distribution.
All simulations from $Uniform(0,1)$ pseudo-random values, and transform them to values from target distribution
