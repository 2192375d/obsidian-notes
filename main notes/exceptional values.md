# exceptional values
The IEEE floating point standard provides two additional special values that indicate exceptional situations
- $INF$, which means "infinity", results in a finite number divide by $0$
- $NaN$, which means "not a number", results from undefined or indeterminate operations such as $\displaystyle\frac{0}{0},0*INF, \frac{Inf}{Inf}$
