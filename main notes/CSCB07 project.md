# to ask
- how will Jira usage be graded?
Don't have to be an advanced nor shallow use of Jira, keep track of user stories, 
- Does this apply to every single meeting? Do we only need to complete it for the weekly planning session, and how regorous should this be
(2 or 3 sentences per person is enough for indivual meeting)

- Can we have the documentations written by AI?
- Can we use AI generated code

regards to the app:
- access control: implement anyway you see fit, 
-
